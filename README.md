IT Support Enthusiast | Certified by Google & Cisco

I turned my curiosity for how computers work into a skilled craft through self-directed learning and rigorous certification. My GitHub is a living portfolio of my journey into IT.

Here, you'll find my home lab projects where I:
- 💻 Install, configure, and troubleshoot Windows & Linux systems.
- 🔐 Manage user access and permissions to practice security basics.
- 🛡️ Implement backup and disaster recovery plans.
- 📡 Simulate and troubleshoot network connectivity issues.

Currently building my skills and looking for my first professional opportunity to provide exceptional technical support.

Open to connecting and learning from the community!
